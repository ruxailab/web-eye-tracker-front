  <div id="box">
    <Toolbar />
    <v-container class="mt-12">
      <v-row justify="center" align="start">
        <v-col cols="12" lg="5" md="5">
          <v-card outlined>
            <v-card-title>

            <p class="mx-4">
              The calibration works by associating the position of your eyes'
              iris with the coordinates of the circle on the screen.
              <br /><br />
              Before starting the process, turn on the camera and make sure your
              face and eyes are being captured by the model. After clicking
              start please don't leave the current position.
              <br /><br />
              Your task during the calibration is to follow the circles with
              your eyes. Try your best to not look away and to keep following.
              Blinking is fine.
