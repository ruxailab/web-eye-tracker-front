# Contributing to Eye Lab

Thanks for your interest in contributing. Pull requests are welcome, and if you find a bug, please open an issue.

## Getting started

1. **Fork and clone** this repo.
2. **Install dependencies** (see [README](README.md#-local-setup)):
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run serve
   ```
3. **Open an issue** before larger changes so we can align on approach.
4. **Branch** from `main` and keep changes focused (e.g. one fix or feature per PR).

## What to work on

- **Good first issue** – Labeled issues that are suited for new contributors.
- **Bug** – Something broken; please describe steps to reproduce.
- **Enhancement** – New feature or improvement; describe the use case.

Maintainer-only or internal tasks are labeled separately; everything else is open for contributors.

## Pull requests

- Target the `main` branch.
- Keep the PR small and the description clear.
- Ensure `npm run build` passes locally.

We’ll review as soon as we can. Thanks for contributing.
